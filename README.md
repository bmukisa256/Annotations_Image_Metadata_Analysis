Malaria Blood Smear Image Analysis and Annotation Study

Overview

This repository contains the analysis and results of a study on malaria blood smear images and annotations from multiple annotators. The study aimed to investigate the consistency and variability of annotations across different annotators and to identify any patterns or trends in the annotations.

Contents

Individual Annotator Analysis: Notebooks for each of the 6 annotators, containing analysis and results of their individual annotations.
Distribution of Annotations Across Annotators: A notebook containing analysis and results of the distribution of annotations across all annotators.
Data: Malaria blood smear images metadata and corresponding annotations from each annotator.
Methodology

Data Collection: Malaria blood smear images were collected and annotated by 6 individual annotators.
Data Analysis: Annotations from each annotator were analyzed separately. The distribution of annotations across all annotators was also analyzed.
Results: Results of the analysis are presented in the notebooks for each annotator and in the notebook for the distribution of annotations across annotators.
Findings

Conclusion

This study provides insights into the consistency and variability of annotations across different annotators and identifies patterns and trends in the annotations. The findings of this study can be used to inform further research and to improve the annotation process.
